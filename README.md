# 🧑‍⚖️esx_parlament

This is a rework of the esx_taxijob, originally developed for "The Bulgarian Streets RP". This adds a municipality job for lawyers, judges mayors and stuff. It is setup for the cityhall, but if you don't have it and you still wanna use the script just edit the config.lua file located in the folder.
